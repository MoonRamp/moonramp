# Master Merchant

MoonRamp is a multi-tennant system that supports any number of merchant accounts. Data and permissions are scoped to merchants. The general exception to this rule is the `Master Merchant` which has an elevated role in the system. The primary value the `Master Merchant` provides is setting the default programs and creating other merchants.

The next sections of the guide will go through running MoonRamp with each of the support data stores.
