# Contributing to MoonRamp

Pull request, bug reports, and feedback are welcome.

## Requirements

* Commits MUST be gpg signed
* Commits MUST be rebased
* Contributors are strongly encouraged to stay anonymous

## Workflow

- Open a PR from your fork-branch
- Code will be reviewed by maintainers
- Code will be rebased by a maintainer onto master and pushed once accepted
  - Github rules are configured to prevent pushes to master that are not PRed, passing CI builds, or signed


## Future Changes

The project will likely come to adopt a set of standards for PR's, documentation, etc in the near future.
